# Notes
## Sort function
- `void sort (RandomAccessIterator first, RandomAccessIterator last)`
- `void sort (RandomAccessIterator first, RandomAccessIterator last, Compare comp)`
- C++ is using introsort, which is a combination of heap sort, quicksort and insertion sort to minimize time
- Note to self: Go over all the sorts again

## Greedy Problem
- Ask myself, would making this choice prevent me from finding the solution in any edge case. If not, be greedy
